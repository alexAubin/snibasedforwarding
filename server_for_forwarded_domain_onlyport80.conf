# This snippet is only here to redirect traffic to another domain on port 80,
# which is also forwarded for port 443 based on the SNI (which is handled
# differently because of the whole SNI story) 

# We don't explicitly redirect to HTTPS by default and let the forwarded server
# handle the redirection (or not depending on what's configured on the other
# server)

# NB: you are expected to replace {{ domain }} and {{ ip }} 
# with the appropriate values such as "domainB.tld" and "1.2.3.4"
